### Description
Wordle-Solver is a program written in python (backend) to help people play the game. Wordle is a really popular game made viral by it's inscrutable and quirky emoji-based game description. Based on a hueristic metric, Wordle-Solver helps WORDLE players find the best words for the next try.The program uses every bit of information gained from WORDLE's reponse to calculate the selection probabilities of the words using the hueristic metric. The responses from the tries will help Wordle-Solver narrow down to a single, if not a few, possible English word(s).
